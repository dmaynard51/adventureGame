An adventure game written in C code. To compile 

Run ./compileall

This program (buildrooms) will randomly create 7 rooms, in a buildrooms.pid
folder. It will make sure each room has at least 6 or less

The adventure program will first print out the starting room (depending which is randomly created)
in the build rooms folder. It will then take the correct patch depending on user input until the
END room is found. Utilizes lpthreads and process ID's. 

For input you can enter the rooms provided, and you can type "time" to get the current time which will be written
in a text file in the same folder.
